# umweltd — the engine as a service

The engine stays a library; `umweltd` (in `src/umweltd/`) wraps it as a local daemon
so every harness — and eventually every SaaS — talks to one brain surface.

**Sibling consumers** (septacrypt-core, umwelt-market, …) should pin this repo by
git SHA or editable path and treat the daemon as substrate truth — see
[FIELD_NOTES_SEPTACRYPT.md](FIELD_NOTES_SEPTACRYPT.md) §4–5 for service asks
(composite world hash, cassette/event batches, snapshot↔checkpoint mapping).

**Knot Ledger + hive (planned attachment):** the field path remains
`events.db` → ingest → `snapshot.pkl` + `field_canon_hash`. A future optional
`knot/` store binds **witnessed history** (stamps/certificates) to those anchors
and publishes **digests only** to a blockchain hive coordination surface.
Connection map, route sketches, and `umwelt.knot.anchor.v1` JSON live in
[FIELD_NOTES_SEPTACRYPT.md §K](FIELD_NOTES_SEPTACRYPT.md). Do not collapse chain
finality into the belief field or replace the ingest log with the stamp DAG.

## Shape

```
harness / SaaS app ──HTTP──▶ supervisor (:7071) ──proxy──▶ worker (world A)
                                   │                        worker (world B)
                                   └── catalog: $UMWELTD_HOME/worlds/<name>/
```

- **One world = one worker process.** Vocabulary registries are process-global, so a
  world imports exactly one domain's vocabulary; workers give crash/CPU isolation for
  free.
- **The log is the truth, the snapshot is a cache.** Every posted event is appended to
  the world's `events.db` (the umwelt.events schema) *before* ingest; snapshots save
  the engine plus a cursor; boot = load snapshot + replay the log tail through the
  production ingest path. This is the cassette pattern run live.
- **Shadow-first over the wire.** `GET /recommendations` is the ghost layer; nothing
  dispatches unless the app supplies a dispatcher (a later phase adds webhook dispatch,
  still opt-in per output).

## API

Supervisor (`python -m umweltd.supervisor`, default `:7071`):

| route | verb | body → result |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | supervisor + per-world liveness |
| `/worlds` | GET/POST | catalog / `{"name","spec":"module:ATTR","vocabulary":"module:fn"?}` |
| `/worlds/<n>/stop` `/start` | POST | lifecycle (stop snapshots on the way out) |
| `/worlds/<n>/*` | any | proxied to the worker |

Worker (behind the proxy):

| route | verb | body → result |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | `{world, step, last_event_ts, seed_profile, events_db_bytes, snapshot_bytes}` |
| `/events` | POST | `{"events":[[ts,sid,value,meta|null],...]}` → append + ingest |
| `/state` | GET | the canonical `graph_state` projection |
| `/beliefs?node=&role=` | GET | one raw substrate belief read (debug; prefer host face for games) |
| `/recommendations` | GET | the shadow layer |
| `/snapshot` | POST | save + cursor → `{"field_canon_hash"}` |

Client: `umweltd.client.UmweltClient` (stdlib-only). Operator CLI: `umweltctl`
(`src/umweltd/cli.py`) wraps the client for the common loop without hand-rolled
HTTP — `umweltctl worlds`, `create`, `stop`, `start`, `health`, `state`, `belief`,
`recommendations`, `snapshot`, `ingest --file batch.json`. Reads `UMWELTD_URL` /
`UMWELTD_API_KEY` from the environment so it needs no flags in the common case.

## The playground and the docs site

The supervisor serves a browser surface next to the JSON API (no build step, no
external assets — works on an air-gapped LAN):

- **`/ui`** — the playground: pick a world, watch per-node/per-role beliefs ease in
  near-real-time (auto-refreshing bars over `/state`'s bloch clusters), push
  readings at declared bindings (`GET /worlds/<n>/bindings`, new), and read the
  shadow decisions. The page loads without auth (it holds no world data); every
  API call it makes carries the `X-API-Key` the visitor enters, kept in their
  browser's localStorage.
- **`/docs`** — the project docs rendered as HTML (the plain-terms overview first),
  read from the repo checkout (or `UMWELT_DOCS_DIR`). A package-only deployment
  without a checkout serves a clear "docs not bundled" page.
- **`/`** redirects to `/ui`. Set `UMWELTD_UI=off` to kill the whole static
  surface (JSON API untouched).
- **Export the docs** as a standalone static site you can zip and send:
  `python -m umweltd.docsite --export ./umwelt-docs`.

## Sharing on your LAN (a friend tries it)

```bash
export UMWELTD_API_KEY=pick-something-long
umweltd --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7071        # refuses to start keyless off-localhost
hostname -I                                # your LAN address
```

Your friend opens `http://<your-lan-ip>:7071/ui`, enters the API key, and plays —
same URL + `X-API-Key` header for raw API/scripting use
(`UmweltClient("http://<ip>:7071", world="...", api_key="...")`).

Notes:
- **WSL2**: `hostname -I` gives the WSL NAT address, unreachable from the LAN.
  Either enable mirrored networking (`.wslconfig`: `networkingMode=mirrored`,
  Windows 11 22H2+) or forward the port from Windows (admin PowerShell):
  `netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=7071 listenaddress=0.0.0.0
  connectport=7071 connectaddress=<wsl-ip>` — plus a Windows Firewall inbound
  allow for 7071.
- The API key is the ONLY gate: anyone holding it can create/stop worlds and
  ingest. Share it like a password, rotate it by restarting with a new value, and
  put TLS (`UMWELTD_TLS_CERT`/`UMWELTD_TLS_KEY` or your own proxy) in front of
  anything beyond a trusted LAN.
- `/ui` and `/docs` are deliberately readable without the key (static product
  surface, no world data); `UMWELTD_UI=off` if even that is too open.

## Running it in a container

```bash
docker build -t umweltd .
docker run -p 7071:7071 -e UMWELTD_API_KEY=... -v umweltd-data:/data umweltd
# or: UMWELTD_API_KEY=... docker compose up
```

The image installs the package (`src/` only — `proofs/`/`examples/`/`tests/` stay
out, same as the published package) and runs `umweltd --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7071`;
binding `0.0.0.0` still enforces the `UMWELTD_API_KEY` requirement below, so an
unconfigured container refuses to start rather than serving unauthenticated. State
lives on the `/data` volume (`UMWELTD_HOME`).

## Contracts and caveats (Phase S2)

- **Parity is the founding claim**: wire replay hash-equals library replay, and
  kill/respawn recovers the exact state (`tests/test_daemon_parity.py`, pinned).
- Batch boundaries are per-request: one `POST /events` = one
  `replay_sensor_batches` pass. A live pusher sends one request per flush window.
- **Auth**: set `UMWELTD_API_KEY` and every request needs `X-API-Key`; binding
  beyond localhost (`--host`) *requires* the key. **TLS**: point
  `UMWELTD_TLS_CERT`/`UMWELTD_TLS_KEY` at a PEM pair (or terminate at your proxy).
- **Gauge discipline**: a recovery tail replays under the REPLAY gauge (actuate=0 —
  old decisions never re-dispatch), then the world stamps LIVE; a manifest
  `"gauge": "replay"` keeps a pure replay world.
- **Webhook dispatch**: a manifest `"webhook_url"` POSTs every AUTO (non-shadow)
  Action as JSON (`tests/test_webhook_dispatch.py`); shadow remains the default and
  the law, and a dead sink never kills the world.
- **Sparse cadence is now a spec declaration**: give the world's DomainSpec a
  `ingest_hold_s` and the engine honors ingest gaps as bounded zero-order hold
  (`tests/test_wall_pacing.py`) — no pusher-side republish burst needed.
- **`spec_path`**: a manifest key (`"spec_path": "/abs/dir"` or a list) the worker
  prepends to `sys.path` before the spec ref imports — how a world authored outside
  the installed packages (an `umwelt-forge` workspace, docs/FORGE.md) boots and
  event-source-recovers identically (`tests/test_forge_spec_path.py`). Trust model:
  spec_path is arbitrary code execution *by design* — exactly the trust already
  granted to the `spec` ref itself; both import a module into the worker process.
- **Crashed workers self-heal**: the supervisor tracks which worlds are `desired`
  (added by `create`/`start`, removed by `stop` — so an operator-requested stop is
  never mistaken for a crash) and a background watchdog
  (`UMWELTD_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_S`, default 10s) restarts any `desired` world whose
  process exited on its own. After 5 crashes inside a 300s rolling window it gives up
  and logs an error instead of tight-looping — a manual `POST /worlds/<n>/start`
  clears that backoff (`tests/test_supervisor_hardening.py`).
- **Guardrails and logging**: `UMWELTD_MAX_WORLDS` (unset = unlimited) caps how many
  worlds one supervisor will create. `UMWELTD_LOG_LEVEL` (default `INFO`) controls
  both processes' logging; every request emits one JSON access-log line
  (`{"event":"access","method","path","status","latency_ms",...}`) in addition to the
  human-readable startup/crash/webhook messages. The `X-API-Key` check is
  constant-time (`hmac.compare_digest`).
- Still Phase S3+: multi-tenant quotas (scoped API keys), vocabulary plugin registry,
  per-output autonomy billing, engine chaining across worlds.
